# Slack TCL
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matthis-d/slack-tcl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matthis-d/slack-tcl)

## Goal
Enable use of `/tcl` in Slack in order to get information about next buses times.

## Development
This project is at the very beginning. There is still a lot of things to do.

I am waiting for TCL authorizations to get real time information.
